# define a function by using def keywod
def greet():
    print("Hello, how are you?")


# Call a function. We can call this function 100 times as well.
# greet()
# greet()
# greet()
# greet()
# greet()
# This won't return anything. It will just print the result in the console.
# Hence, this is called as non - return type functions.

# Can we use for loop also?
# for i in range(5):  # This function will call 5 times i.e. 0 to 4
#     greet()

# call the function by using below
result = greet()
print(result)  # If I try to print the output, "None" will get print which means this function doesn't return anything.
