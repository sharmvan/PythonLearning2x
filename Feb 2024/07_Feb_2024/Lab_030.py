# Where we see negation? means We can't use this operator "!" directly, but we can use with brackets
x = 10
y = 20
print(x == y)  # It will produce "False". In such kind of cases we can use "!"
print(x != y)  # Not equal to sign (!=) x is not equal to y. yes it's True
print(not y)  # Not is single operator. What is not of y? false we will not be using this.
# not operator should be used with boolean only.
