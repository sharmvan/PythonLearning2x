# 1.Arithmetic Operators:--
# x = 19
# y = 3
# print(x + y)
# print(x - y)
# print(x * y)
# print(x / y)
# print(x % y)
# print(x ** y)
# print(x // y)

# 2.Assignment Operators:--
# x = 10
# x = 10 + 2
# print(x)
#
# x = 10
# x += 2
# print(x)
# x -= 4
# print(x)
# x *= 6
# print(x)
# x /= 8
# print(x)
# x %= 10
# print(x)
# x **= 5
# print(x)
# x //= 3
# print(x)


# 3.Comparison Operators:--
# x = 54
# y = 23
# print(x == y)
# print(x != y)
# print(x > y)
# print(x < y)
# print(x >= y)
# print(x <= y)

# 4.Logical Operators:--
# x = 56
# y = 10
# print(x == y and x > y)
# print(x == y or x > y)
# print(not x)
# print(not y)

# 5.Identity Operators:--
# x = ["Classroom", "Teacher"]
# y = ["Classroom", "Teacher"]
# print(x is y)  # "is" compares the object
# print(x == y)  # "==" compares the contents
# print(x is not y)  # "is not" compares the object

# 6.Membership Operators:-- To check the value is there in the list or not
# x = ["Classroom", "Teacher"]
# y = ["Classroom", "Teacher"]
# print("Teacher" in y)
# print("Classroom" not in x)

# 7.Bitwise Operators:--
# & - AND
# | - OR
# ~ - Not
# ^ - XOR

# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11

# x = 1
# y = 3
# print(x & y)
# print(x | y)
