try: # try is just a block.
    # We can write any code here like
    # loop,
    # if else,
    # switch etc
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
else: # else is not mandatory. It is just like try to execute "try" block. If exception is not there, then else block will
    # get executed. All of them is optional. There is nothing mandatory in this case.
# Can we have multiple try block in one class? Yes, we can have.
