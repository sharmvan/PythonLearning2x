# Now our journey will start towards API Automation but before learning API Automation, we need to understand
# a couple of concepts which is:
# 1. HTTP Fundamentals
# 2. API Testing with project#1 with postman, and we will automate that project by using the request library.
# 3. Then we will learn libraries in the python which are basically used to make other things.

# 4. Then we will learn about a couple of other concepts like below:
# -> Request module--> API Request
# -> pytest --> Testing Framework, Run your test cases
# -> Reporting --> Allure Report
# -> File Handling, csv, excel, Yaml, read JSON file
# -> Python loops, list, dict, set

# Project#2
# Web Automation
# 1.Selenium +POM
# 2.Pytest (this is similar to TestNG)
# 3.Reporting
# 4.File & Misc concepts are same as in APIs
