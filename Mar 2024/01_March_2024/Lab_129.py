# Let's understand--> I went to my ATM to withdraw money. 1st step, I inserted my card to withdraw 10K rupees. ATM
# tell me to enter PIN. I entered my PIN: 0000 and it says that money got deducted. I got a message of money
# deducted. and all of a sudden I got an error with red color on machine and afterward nothing happened. And I was so
# pissed of at the SBI like why they have done this to me. I got a message that 10K rupees got deducted. I didn't get
# the money and on the screen, I got a generic message "something went wrong" and then it restarted. In this case,
# if you see there was a problem in the code, but a developer who developed this code, he/she didn't handled the
# exception very well. If you don't handle the exception, it will look like bad user experience and user will always
# curse you. Hence, to avoid the bas user experience, we have to handled the exceptions. An Exception is an event
# that occur during the execution of the program.That disturbs the normal flow of execution of the program. So,
# in this case, if the value of b becomes less than 0 or become 0, this program we won't be able to use it and we
# need to handle this error.
