# String (bunch of characters). Also Immutable
# tuple: is a list of any data type item which can't changed.
# list: is collection of items, which can be changed. It accepts duplicate as we can insert same data types
print(dir(tuple)) # By using dir we can see all the functions.
print(dir(list))
# In the list, we have seen below methods/functions:
# append, clear, pop, del, push, extend, remove, sort, add, reverse--> All these methods support to tuple as well.
